What do you say in response HUMAN ?!

3D IN BASIC
IS REAL THING,
BUT SO BORING.
LET'S TRY SOMETHING FASTER

get ready to hop around
through thorns to the stars
like a Rubik's cube

So nice to look at the stars
But sad to realize
The fact that they are so far
From us
I am sure
What is looking
Inside ourselves
Each of us
Can get to the stars
On the stairs of imagination

you can't
control
the singularity,
but able
to control
YOUR
C L A R I T Y

Imagine yourself, that you are
Immersed in deep-deep space
Of ZX Spectrum Basic
It is a completely
Different side
Of speccy universe...
Is it your right way
To white stars?
Is this universe for humans?

If you became a STAR
You will not die
But your light
Can't burn forever
And maybe you
Can find the strenght
To become a...
SUPERNOVA

Combine your DNA
With stardust.
And you will be
A part of Universe.
The Universe
Of White stars.

WITHDRAW INTO YOURSELF
DEEPER AND DEEPER

So easy to become
A White Star.
So hard to shine
For a long time.
Lets give respects now
To the burning stars.

You must try
To move away
From 2d & 3d paradigm
To infinite dimension.
And you will be
A real White Star

Passing through
The impossibility,
You entered,
Through the universe,
In the center of the Supernova,
And became
A WHITE STAR.
