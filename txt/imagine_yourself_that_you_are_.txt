So nice to look at the stars
But sad to realize
The fact that they are so far
From us
I'm sure
What is looking
Inside yourself
Each of us
Can get to the stars
On the stairs of our imaginations

That they are so far away
From us
I am sure
That by looking
Inside ourselves
Each of us
Can reach out
To the STARS
